# fuse-jna

## Grab it

    https://jitpack.io/#umjammer/fuse-jna

## Make your own filesystem

1. Subclass `net.fusejna.FuseFilesystem` and override the methods you need (For convenience, there is an adapter called `FuseFilesystemAdapterFull`).

2. Create an instance of your subclass, then call `.mount(mountpoint)` on it.

3. The filesystem will be unmounted automatically at JVM shutdown time if possible. You can unmount it at runtime using `.unmount()`.

4. ???

5. Profit.

6. *(Bonus)* You can get logging for free by calling `.log(true)` or `.log(myLogger)` on the filesystem instance.

## The longer stuff

### The idea
fuse-jna was born out of the desire for no-compilation-required, no-bullshit, actually-working bindings to the FUSE library.

Originally built to make the OS X/Linux port of [SrcDemo²] possible, it was separated into its own library because I figured others would benefit from it.

I like Python, and I like using [fuse.py] when writing FUSE filesystems in Python. Thanks to `ctypes`, it comes in just one file and that's all you need for nice 'n' straight Python bindings.
The goal of fuse-jna is to bring FUSE bindings to Java with the same simplicity.

To do that, it uses [JNA], which itself was inspired by Python's `ctypes` in terms of ease-of-use.

### "Help! It's too slow!"

First and foremost, this library uses [JNA] for bindings, rather than [JNI]. Do not expect native performance. If you need native performance, look elsewhere.

This being said, you can greatly increase throughput by preventing FUSE from chunking writes in tiny blocks, tweaking some JVM parameters, etc. See [issue 31][Issue 31] for details.

Other fuse libraries have popped up that use [JNR] instead of JNA. You might want to use them instead: [javafs], [jnr-fuse].

### Compatibility

Following [fuse.py], fuse-jna should work with:

* OS X with [MacFUSE]/[fuse4x]/[OSXFUSE] on Intel architectures
* Linux with [FUSE][Linux-Fuse] on Intel, ARM, and PowerPC architectures
* FreeBSD with [FUSE][FreeBSD-Fuse] on Intel architectures
